# Malware Analysis

The art of breaking apart malware/code to understand its functionality.

#1. - Virtual Machines
-----------------------------------------

- Windows 10 FlareVM: https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm
    - FLARE VM is a freely available and open sourced Windows-based security distribution designed for reverse engineers, malware analysts, incident responders, forensicators, and penetration testers. Inspired by open-source Linux-based security distributions like Kali Linux, REMnux and others, FLARE VM delivers a fully configured platform with a comprehensive collection of Windows security tools such as debuggers, disassemblers, decompilers, static and dynamic analysis utilities, network analysis and manipulation, web assessment, exploitation, vulnerability assessment applications, and many others.

- Remnux VM: https://remnux.org/
    - REMnux® is a Linux toolkit for reverse-engineering and analyzing malicious software. REMnux provides a curated collection of free tools created by the community. Analysts can use it to investigate malware without having to find, install, and configure the tools.

#2. - Static Analysis
-----------------------------------------

The art of analysing malware without execution.

- Basic = looking at any and everything other than the assembly code.

- Advanced = looking at code in a disassembler usually Ghidra/IDA/Binja etc..

We look at the filetype, hashes, strings (indicator of what we are dealing with), sections, imports (what API calls the process may make/non-presence could mean the application is packed) etc... Quick win/quick triage = chance of not repeating what fellow researchers have done.
